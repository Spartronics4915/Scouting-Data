# 2025 Auburn Data has not yet been posted.
Check back later, it should be posted by 9:15pm, Saturday, March 22. Keep checking here for updates.

# (4) 9:15 Guarantee
Barring unforseen circumstances, we intend to upload our data by 9:15pm on the first day of a competition.

We don't guarentee perfect data but it should be mostly accurate.

We intend on posting scouting data first and we might include pit scouting data as well.

# How to access the data
Go to the event that you want to access, and download the files.
There are some files that might be included:
1. Match Data (CSV) - Our data from match scouting
2. Pit Data (CSV) - Our data from pit scouting
3. Orpheus Settings File (.orpheus) - Use this to get started in Orpheus. See more information below.

# Orpheus
