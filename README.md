# 2025 Pacific Northwest FIRST District Championship
Our full pit scouting data is uploaded, as well as matches 1-30. Some robots may have duplicate data

### We are waiting for our alliance partners to send us their data

Since Districts ends 2 hours earlier than most other competitions, we'll upload our data on Thursday and Friday night by 7:15pm instead of 9:15pm.

We are in a scouting alliance with **2412 Robototes and 4512 Otter Chaos**. Robototes is contributing most of the data on the Blue Alliance and Otter Chaos is also contributing data on the blue alliance. Huge shout-out to these teams, this data would not be available without them <3

# (4) 9:15 Guarantee
Barring unforseen circumstances, we intend to upload our data by 9:15pm on the advertised days of competition.

If data will be posted late or missing, it'll be mentioned somewhere on here before 9:15.

We don't guarentee perfect data but it should be mostly accurate.

We intend on posting scouting data first and we might include pit scouting data as well.

# How to access the data
Go to the event that you want to access, and download the files.
There are some files that might be included:
1. Match Data (CSV) - Our data from match scouting
2. Pit Data (CSV) - Our data from pit scouting
3. Orpheus Settings File (.orpheus) - Use this to get started in Orpheus. See more information below.

If you notice anything that seems wrong with Orpheus, like a bug or glitch, if you could put it on an issue on the [Orpheus repository](https://github.com/FinnSpartronics/Orpheus) or ping `@slothh__` in the PNW FRC Discord, or let any other member of Spartronics know, that would be greatly appreciated
